    <h1>FAIK MOHCINE</h1>
        
        <p>I believe technology is the most powerful engine for business transformation, but only if it's pointed in the right direction.
             My passion is creating order from chaos, ensuring that every dollar invested in IT directly fuels strategic growth, operational excellence,
              and competitive advantage.

            I translate business vision into an executable technology roadmap.

        </p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
        
        <p>I get immense satisfaction from sitting at the intersection of business and technology.
        I love translating C-suite ambitions into a concrete portfolio of projects and then translating IT's progress back into business value stories.</p>

            <p>
                I'm not just passionate about delivering projects on time and budget; I'm obsessed with delivering value.
